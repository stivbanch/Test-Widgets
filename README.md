# Widgets JavaFX test
Widget for all platforms - early stage.

Creating desktop widgets, system shortcuts for shutdown, restart and logoff computer.

Idea is that if you want, you can have single system shortcut icon for faster
manipulation OS, what ever user need to monitoring in real time on his computer.

Every single icon can be placed where you want on desktop using "move" icon, 
application will remember possition, leaving maximum workspace that user need
for his desktop.

Application is tested on Windows 10 and Linux Ubuntu v16.04.

For this project I used Java SE Development Kit JDK 8u101  and NetBeans IDE 8.1.

Code is writing in JavaFX, icons are modeling in 3ds Max, Corel Draw and Photoshop.

S7.jar file can be used for testing program on all platforms...
